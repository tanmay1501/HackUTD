LTV
The Loan-To-Value (LTV) is above or at 80% which will require you to purchase mortgage insurance or to purchase Prive Mortgage insurance (PMI) which will increase the total cost in payments made each month. Your credit rating will decrease in worth because you are borrowing more than you can repay in a given amount of time.

One of our solutions for lowering your LTV is to make a higher down payment when purchasing a home. This means that the loan will decrease and the LTV will decrease as a result.

DTI
Your Debt-To-Income (DTI) ratio is above 43% which means our lenders are not allowed to sell loans over that rate. 

One solution to decrease your DTI score is to transfer your high-interest loans to a low-interest credit card. Keep in mind that having too many credit cards will also make buying a house more difficult.

FEDTI
Your Front-End To Debt To Income (FEDTI) ratio is higher than 28% which means your total debt compared to income is too high to sell you a home.

One of our solutions is to decrease your total debt to 28% or lower. Taking this necessary step will ensure homesellers that you are capable of paying the interest and loan needed to purchase a home.  

Credit Score
Your Credit Score was found to be below 640, which will make it difficult to purchase a home.

One of our solutions for you is to pay your credit card amount every month and to not miss any important payments. Continually making payments will increase your creidt score which will allow you to purchase a home.
