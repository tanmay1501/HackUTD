We suggest to transfer your high-interest loans to a low-interest credit card.\n   Keep in mind that having too many credit cards will also make buying a house more difficult.\n2. We suggest paying down revolving or installment debts, reducing housing costs, and increasing income\n3. Your Loan-To-Value (LTV) is above or at 80%.\n  We suggest you to purchase Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) which will increase the total cost in payments made each month\n4. We suggest to pay your credit card amount every month and to not miss any important payments.\n  Continually making payments will increase your creidt score which will allow you to purchase a home."}
