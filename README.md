## Inspiration
We were inspired by the format presented by the Fannie Mae website and so we wanted to create an evaluation page on the website that will show 2 pie charts and will give suggestions depending on which factor given makes the applicant unable to buy a home.

## What it does
What our project does is it will take an input file with data such as monthly income, loan amount, credit score, and down payment and you will be given 2 options: create or analyze. The create option will show all the data from the file in an easily readable way for the user to see. The analyze option will go to a new page and analyze the data and there will be 2 links given for a LTV calculator and a DTI calculator which will show the calculations to determine each. Below the links will be 2 interactable pie graphs which will show the LTV and DTI between each data set. Lastly, the analysis will determine if the variables given will make each data set eligible for buying a home and if not, then a suggestion will be given based on which variable made the set ineligible.

## How we built it
First we used Python in Visual Studio Code to make the back-end of the code (the data analysis) and then we used the framework React to make a GUI for the program. Then we utilized React Graph to make the interactable graphs shown in the analysis page. Lastly, we used Figma to show how our project would be utilized on the Fannie Mae website and how it would work.

## Challenges we ran into
Our first major challenge was determining how

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We created a whole full stack project from scratch in less than 24 hours.

## What we learned
we learned a lot on various technology and increased our tech stack by adding React, Figma, python CSV libraries and many more useful knowledge which we will use in our professional experience
